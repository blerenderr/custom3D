Culling solution taken from this page: https://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/view-frustum-culling/radar-approach-testing-points/

Still very much a WiP and probably won't work well for a while.
## Current Progress
### Done:
.obj file support, looks for the files in same dir as executable

has some clipping that works but is probably slower than it could be

### Doing now:
textures, viewmodels, UI, idk
