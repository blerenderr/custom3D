# custom3D
A custom 3D projection program utilizing C++ and SDL2. The main formulae for transformations were yoinked from the Wikipedia page for 3D perspective projection.

Culling solution taken from this page: https://www.lighthouse3d.com/tutorials/view-frustum-culling/radar-approach-testing-points/

Still very much a WiP and probably won't work well for a while.
## Future Ideas
Add ability to import .mdl files or similar, distance culling, collision, eventually maybe vertex shading

-> .obj file support added!
working on clipping and culling right now.
